## Simple calculator

I challenged myself to build a simple calculator that has all the numbers clickable and then output it on text field that will be computed by arithmetic operator buttons. This project was meant to assess myself on javascript but everything went easy when I discovered the eval() function lol. I did not refractored the codes in script.js file as it will serve as my reference on how I built it from scratch. The design of this calculator was based on the discord app.
